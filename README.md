Here's my calculator project!

to run this project: run `npm i` in this project's root directory, and in calculator/

to start the testing environment, run `npm run start:dev` once in the calculator/ directory,
then open `calculator/views/index.html` in your browser (make sure to emulate a phone screen in your debug options, or it will look quite strange).

If you wish to build the standalone android app, run `npm run build` in the calculator/ directory. This will output a .apk file in the calculator/dist directory.
